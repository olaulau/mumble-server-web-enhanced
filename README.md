mumble-server-web-enhanced
==========================

mumble web interface, based on the mumble-server-web old package

You shoud download [v0.1] (https://github.com/olaulau/mumble-server-web-enhanced/tree/v0.1) tag/release, last "working and clean" version.
It currently displays an ASCII tree with channels and players.

I'm currently working on a nicer version using [JSTree] (http://www.jstree.com/demo/)

See [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/olaulau/mumble-server-web-enhanced/blob/master/INSTALL.md) for detailed installation instructions.
