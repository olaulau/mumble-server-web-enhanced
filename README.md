### Requirements
- PHP (7.4 tested)
- PHP module zeroconf ice (php-zeroc-ice package under Debian / Ubuntu)

### Features
- PHP based : no django requirement
- pull and refresh data's over AJAX, thanks to [JsTree](http://www.jstree.com/) usage
- status icons as in mumble client
- URL parameters (decoration=0 , scale=0.75) to easy site integration
- reduced mode, which hides empty channels

Current version is nearly final, basic features are all here.
### Futures enhancements
- remember closed nodes (so refresh will be nicer)
- display more info about players (hover layer)
- display server info (root node hover layer)
- add footer link to sources
- add small buttons to refresh and open a full viewer
