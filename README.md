mumble-server-web-enhanced
==========================

a Mumble web interface, based on the mumble-server-web old package

New version [v0.2](https://github.com/olaulau/mumble-server-web-enhanced/tree/v0.2) with tree display (thanks to [JSTree](http://www.jstree.com/demo/)), and AJAX refresh.
It currently displays a tree with channels and players.

Next version will focus on displaying more informations, and design (as in mumble client).

See [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/olaulau/mumble-server-web-enhanced/blob/master/INSTALL.md) for detailled installation instructions.
